# Pacman - Unity Project
#### This is a study project, part of my study streak following Zigurous tutorials.



I've been trying not to follow one-to-one on the tutorial, so I implemented just some basics like a simple UI and simple SFX. My intention is to go back to this and other projects and implement what I'm able to learn.
## UI

```bash

## SFX
